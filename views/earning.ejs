  We’re experimenting with a couple ways to pay you, our contributors.

<section class="earning-types">
  <div class="earning-types-type-block">
    <h2>POINTS & PRIZES</h2>
      <p>
        LOREM IPSUM POINTS
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="earning-types-type-block">
    <h2>BOUNTIES</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes ELLEN’s customers (the organizations who pay for insights) want specific data on an individual company during a certain time period. We will incentivize submissions during that period with bounties, or small cash rewards for contributing that specific data point.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you delete your data, the datapoints uploaded for bounties cannot be deleted, however are always anonymized in the insights we present. 
      </p>

  <div class="earning-types-type-block">
    <h2>50/50 split</h2>
      <p>
        We split profits with our contributors. Think of it like a dividend. At the end of each year, you’ll get the choice of a cash reward or a gift card to one of your favorite retailers.       </p>
      <p>
        We assign a value to each company based on how many customers subscribe to the data and then allocate those profits generated by that company to the contributors who have shared data for that company.
