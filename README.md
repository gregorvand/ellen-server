# Data DTC v1 (Ellen Insights)

## Up and Running

This is a Node/Express/Postgres/Sequelize -based app, and currently uses simple EJS templating for server-side rendering of views

- npm i
- copy `/server/congif_template.json` and rename to `config.json` and add PG database info
- copy `.env_template` and rename to `.env`, add required details (get from an existing developer)
- npm run start:dev to begin server on 8000
- npm run sass to start watching scss /compiling css files from `/sass` if needed
