  <h1>How we <br> pay you</h1>
</section>

<section class="subtitle">
  We’re experimenting with a couple ways to pay you, our contributors.
</section>

<section class="earning-types">
  <div class="earning-types-type-block">
    <h2>POINTS & PRIZES</h2>
      <p>
        For every email submitted to Ellen, you will receive points. There are also bonus points available for when you submit the first datapoint (email) for a given company, or submit multiple valid datapoints for the same company. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Every month Ellen will reward the top points scorers during that period with real cash - you know, money you can buy things with, not vouchers or other corporate-owned currencies.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Points are launching very soon! <br> We expect them to be live in May 2021</strong></p>
  </div>
  <div class="earning-types-type-block">
    <h2>BOUNTIES</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes ELLEN’s customers (the organizations who pay for insights) want specific data on an individual company during a certain time period. We will incentivize submissions during that period with bounties, or small cash rewards for contributing that specific data point.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you delete your data, the datapoints uploaded for bounties cannot be deleted, however are always anonymized in the insights we present. 
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="earning-types-type-block">
    <h2>50/50 split</h2>
      <p>
        We will split profits with our contributors. Think of it like a dividend. At the end of each year, you’ll get the choice of a cash reward or a gift card to one of your favorite retailers.       </p>
      <p>
        We assign a value to each company based on how many customers subscribe to the data and then allocate those profits generated by that company to the contributors who have shared data for that company.
      </p>
      <p>Ellen is not currently profitable and we will keep all users updated when we reach that milestone</p>
